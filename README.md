# Test Assignment

In this topic, you will learn how to apply custom NGINX settings to a running pod by modifying and upgrading its Helm chart.

## Prerequisites
* The host machine is running Windows 10 or later.
* [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) is installed.
* The [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) package manager is installed.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

1. Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Install Minikube:
```powershell
winget install Kubernetes.Minikube
```
3. Start Minikube. This will also install Kubernetes.
```powershell
minikube start
```
4. Install Helm:
```powershell
choco install kubernetes-helm -y
```
5. Check that the Kubernetes version is 1.23 or later:
```powershell
kubectl version
```
6. Check that the Helm version is 3.8.0 or later:
```powershell
helm version
````
Step one done! Everything is now set up to continue deploying NGINX from a Helm chart.

## Step 2: Deploying NGINX and Verifying the Deployment

1. Download and unzip the [Bitnami NGINX Open Source Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/nginx):
```powershell
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/nginx --untar
```
**Note:** Unlike the [Bitnami instructions](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/nginx), we will first use `helm pull` instead of `helm install` because we need to download the Helm chart to edit it later.
 
2. Deploy NGINX from the downloaded Helm chart and name the deployment `my-nginx`:
```powershell
helm install my-nginx ./nginx
```
3. Start a background PowerShell session and set up port forwarding from port 8080 on your machine to port 80 on the Kubernetes service `my-nginx`:
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "kubectl port-forward svc/my-nginx 8080:80"
```
**Note:** We are running the command above in the background because otherwise it will hold the terminal session.

4. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser. If the NGINX service was deployed correctly, you will see the NGINX start page.

5. Letâ€™s verify the deployment in another way. Return to PowerShell and run the following command:
 
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8080
```
If the NGINX service was deployed correctly, you will receive an HTTP 200 response.

All set! We can now take a closer look at the NGINX settings.

## Step 3: Checking the Default NGINX Logging Level
1. Find the name of the NGINX pod running in your Minikube cluster:
```powershell
kubectl get pods
```
2. Open an interactive shell inside the NGINX pod:
```powershell
kubectl exec -it <POD_NAME> -- bash
```
3. Display the NGINX configuration:
```bash
nginx -T
```
4. Take a closer look at the output of the previous command. Locate the `log_format` and `access_log` directives.

5. Judging from them, the NGINX logging level is set to default. But let's confirm by inspecting the NGINX logs:
```powershell
kubectl logs <POD_NAME>
```
The format of the log entries confirms that the logging level is default.

Let's change it to extended.

## Step 4: Changing the NGINX Logging Level to Extended
1. Locate the `nginx` directory of the downloaded and unzipped Helm chart. By default, Helm saves chart files in the current directory where you ran the command.
2. Open the `nginx` directory and create a file named `custom-values.yaml`.

**Note:** It is not mandatory to create this file inside the Helm chart directory, but we will do so to make running an upcoming command more convenient.

3. Open the `custom-values.yaml` file, add the following lines, and then save the file:
```yaml
serverBlock: |-
  log_format extended '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                      '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for" '
                      'rt=$request_time uct=$upstream_connect_time uht=$upstream_header_time urt=$upstream_response_time';
  access_log /dev/stdout extended;
```
4. Upgrade the Helm release and the running pod by overriding the default NGINX settings with the custom ones defined in the `custom-values.yaml` file:
```powershell
helm upgrade my-nginx ./nginx -f ./nginx/values.yaml -f ./nginx/custom-values.yaml
```
The pod was upgraded. Let's now check that the custom NGINX settings were applied.

5. Inspect the full Kubernetes manifest Helm has generated and applied for `my-nginx`:
```powershell
helm get manifest my-nginx
```
6. Locate the `log-format` and `access-log` directives:
![Alt text](Images/manifest.png)
As you can see, the NGINX logging level was changed to extended. But let's double-check it by looking at the NGINX logs.
7. Find the name of the NGINX pod running in your Minikube cluster:
```powershell
kubectl get pods
```

**Note:** The step above is necessary because upgrading the Helm release and the pods under it also changes the pod names.
 
8. Inspect the NGINX logs:
```powershell
kubectl logs <POD_NAME>
```
The format of the log entries confirms that the new logging level is set to extended:
![Alt text](Images/nignx-log-extended.png)

Congratulations! You have changed the NGINX logging level from `default` to `extended` on the running pod by upgrading the Helm chart.
